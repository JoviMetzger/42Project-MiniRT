 check_elements ensures A L C are declared and only onces
 checks sp cy pl are declared AT LEAST once

 **validate**
 validate checks number of arguments for each element is correct
 and after the identifier, there are only spaces, numbers, dots and commas

 **convert**
 convert splits the string (ft_split), converts each part into number form (how what?, check which it shoud be and then convert ?)
 checks the format etc for each element
 adds to correct part in struct

	- height - simple number, only use a bit, same as diameter
