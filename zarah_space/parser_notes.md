 check_elements ensures A L C are declared and only onces
 checks sp cy pl are declared AT LEAST once

 **validate**
 validate checks number of arguments for each element is correct
 and after the identifier, there are only spaces, numbers, dots and commas

 **convert**
 convert splits the string (ft_split), converts each part into number form (how what?, check which it shoud be and then convert ?)
 checks the format etc for each element
 adds to correct part in struct



 **to do**
 - logic check
 take element by element, convert numbers, check, then add (?)

 - organise this GOOOOD before getting too deep
 takes array, creates second array for each element
 think carefully about error handling!! and memory!!

 - utils
 already got useful shizz in /validate/ reuse pleaseeee
