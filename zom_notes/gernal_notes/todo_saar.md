**key**

!! - done, triple check but no longer a to do
** - in progress with notes/reminders elsewhere
0_0 - omg noooo


**CURRENT SHIZZLE**

0_0 ** !! bleh...
- check cylinder when looking straight on with z vec
	if move up y (or down) cylinder body gets disconnected from the caps...

++ if 0,1,0 0r 1,0,0 and a little to one side, it's lopsided without straight edges... 

 ----- possible link between these two problems....

 

**general situation / to do's / concerns:**

- sphere stretches when close up

- there's new stuff you want in the parser


!! ** 0_0 - inside of objects!! (at least cylinder...) - NOPE


**TEXTURE**

- bool?
- instead of colour for testing but need to know whether texture or rgb, oder?
- haven't gone back to textures yet
