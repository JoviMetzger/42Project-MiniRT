--- no implementing ---
 - dont do window resizing
 - dont do textures, remove extra code
 - no inside objects



--- to do now ---
 - find any calculation that can happen in parsing and not per pixel
 - fix the cylinder:
 		 - cap normal ok?
		 - when cylinder is turned etc, z vec isnt quite ok
	++ if 0,1,0 0r 1,0,0 and a little to one side, it's lopsided without straight edges... 
 - sphere stretching
 - new stuff for parser?
