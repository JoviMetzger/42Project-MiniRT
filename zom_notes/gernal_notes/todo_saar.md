general situation:

- image stretching... we aren't supposed to stretch when resizing the window (remove stretching?)

- i keep crashing/it takes too long, im not sure exactly where that's coming from

- trying to get the surface normal of cylinder, got the equations but not really behaving correctly

- cylinder caps function (checked by vinny too) but stilllllllll no caps...

- new jovi stuff

- worry about changing things to calculate less per pixel? (optimize but also no crash)

- got triangle stuff down, ofc not working yet tho

- are we leaving the main get_colour stuff as it is?

- how are we adding the checkerboard etc?

- we are sharing quite a lot - structs !!

- triple check quadratic, might work for sphere but just incase it's fucking other stuff up

- check closest_t stuff, cause updating that but not actually resetting t or using closest

- i believe plane is good but questioning literally everything at this point...

- there's new stuff you want in the parser

- haven't gone back to textures yet

- we leak 

- inside of objects!! (at least cylinder...)
