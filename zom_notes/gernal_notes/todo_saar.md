hehe
??
fix resize window shizzle


!!!!!
	if camera is 0,0,-1, planes are 1,3,10
		spheres seems to only work at 0,0,-10 but that would be behind the camera
		the spheres can be seen though infront of the planes
	also, cylinder at 0,0,7 is in front of a sphere in the middle
		changing the cylinder to 0,3,7 should move it up the y axis but 
		it moves down..

	- cylinder and spheres seem to be the wrong way around (neg axis is pos and visversa) - i think for all axises, i planes are ok

**3**
- cylinder
		-try using old cylinder equations to see if i can get capping

**4**
- pretty sure we only need one function for all objects but see what jovi thinkss..


**5**
- check lighting...

	- is cylinder working same as sphere and if not whyyyyy

	- if flat 'back wall' facing plane in 0,0,0 black, why gray ?? (light??)



**NEXTTTT**

- triangle + other objects

- finally clean up, remove unused functions, norm and test loadssss
