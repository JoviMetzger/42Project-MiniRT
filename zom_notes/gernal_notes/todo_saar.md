UPDATE

- multiple cylinders woohooo
- NOTHINGG is interacting correctly when it comes to which is infront of the other - so that's 
	my next task
- check my cylinder function, think im putting bottoms on bodies which i dont want


CYLINDER POOOOO

- can't seem to get more than one at one time...
- background is some fucked up plane situation, something (sp) behind it can't been seen
	trying for this to focus the colour on the cylinder with flags but get too much black...
- trying to get the surface normal of cylinder, got the equations but not really behaving correctly
- if return the closest_t check, things get messy...


general situation:

- sphere stretches when close up

- image stretching... we aren't supposed to stretch when resizing the window (remove stretching?)

- i keep crashing/it takes too long, im not sure exactly where that's coming from/oplossing

- new jovi stuff

- worry about changing things to calculate less per pixel? (optimize but also no crash)

- got triangle stuff down, ofc not working yet tho

- are we leaving the main get_colour stuff as it is?

- how are we adding the checkerboard etc?

- we are sharing quite a lot - structs !!

- triple check quadratic, might work for sphere but just incase it's fucking other stuff up

- check closest_t stuff, cause updating that but not actually resetting t or using closest

- i believe plane is good but questioning literally everything at this point...

- there's new stuff you want in the parser

- haven't gone back to textures yet

- we leak 

- inside of objects!! (at least cylinder...) - NOPE
