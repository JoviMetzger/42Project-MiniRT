--- to do now ---

!!!
 - surface normals
 - light array when creating shadow rays...

 - cylinder shape - still wronnnngggggggg
 - inside cylinder + sphere



 - prep eval files, some basic/simple, some more complicated
 - norm everything
 - check all TODO comments

+
 - cylinder vector 1,1,1 ... check
 - anything else we can do to improve speed?
 - do we want loading messages/rending while window open (without pop up)

PARSER:

L              -2,0,-1    0.7    0,/255,0 - IS NOT AN ERROR.... SHOULD BE

normals:

TRIANGLE
obj norm = 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000

SPHERE
obj norm = -0.099434 0.988974 0.109744

CYLINDER - 0,1,1
obj norm = 0.000000 0.707107 0.707107

literally no idea if good or no, triangle should be since it's flat on 0,0,1
