**key**

!! - done, triple check but no longer a to do
** - in progress with notes/reminders elsewhere
0_0 - omg noooo


**CURRENT SHIZZLE**

- sphere surface normal looks good, need to check rest

- check cylinder when looking straight on with z vec
	- if we look straight on, we get circle which is nice, also if move 
		around the x axix
		if move up y (or down) cylinder body gets disconnected from the caps...
	- $$$ i think it might be due to missing the other half of the cylinder... if 
		from looking straight, there is a floating cylinder above, you'll see 
		the bottom of the body, and a cap (closest to you) but also the top bit of the cap (otherwise you'd need to be right underneath the cylinder)
		so we are actually seeing the stuff correctly but seeing that part of the cylinder is missing....
	- $$$ if we only just radius, it fits better when looking from up close, straight on...


**general situation / to do's / concerns:**


- sphere stretches when close up

- there's new stuff you want in the parser

- haven't gone back to textures yet

!! ** 0_0 - inside of objects!! (at least cylinder...) - NOPE
