--- not implementing ---

 - dont do window resizing

 - dont do textures, remove extra code

 - no inside objects (but actually have to for cylinder...?)



--- to do now ---

 - triple check the normals
 - check the cylinder, all positons etc + cutting edges
 - plane flipping + correct normals
 - cylinder plane flipping + correct normals
 - prep eval files, some basic/simple, some more complicated
 - get rid of waiting message -> a little wait is fine but pop no good
 - triple check parser + new light array -> no leaks, no segfaults etc
 - ensure sphere stretching is acceptable, just test lots of positions
 - cylinder vector 1,1,1 ... check
 - anything else we can do to improve speed?

 - if eval sheet explicitly talks about inside objects, we have to look into that...
